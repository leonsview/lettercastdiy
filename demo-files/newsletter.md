Channing's Tweet Pick 🐦


About 12 years ago I let myself down on a big professional goal.
I'd gotten into the habit of noticing every little thing that was outside of my control, and blaming my failures on them.
So I switched things up and adopted the "responsibility assumption" — the idea that EVERYTHING that happens in my life is my fault.
Life is a little harder now, but a lot better. And I haven't let myself down since.

_______

Dear founder, ​This week taught me an unexpected lesson about entrepreneurship. After the Christmas and New Years festivities — that annual tradition of sharing joy, memories, and apparently germs — I found myself running a fever of nearly 40°C (104°F). For someone who rarely gets sick, this hit particularly hard.​🎧 Listen to this on my podcast.​​As I lay in bed, barely able to function, I realized just how crucial it had been to build my businesses the way I did. Both my software company, Podscan, and my media business continued to run smoothly without my active involvement. This forced pause became a powerful reminder of why I chose the entrepreneurial path in the first place: to have control over how I spend my time, what I do with it, and who I work with.The beauty of being an entrepreneur is having the freedom to say, "Today, I'm not working because I need to take care of myself." Yet paradoxically, it's also one of the hardest things to do. When you're running your own business, if you don't show up, often nobody does. That's why I've invested significant effort into making my software business as independent of me as possible.Every feature, every piece of infrastructure in Podscan has been built with self-healing in mind. I've put automations in place that handle everything from service restarts to scaling resources up and down as needed. The system is grounded in resilient architecture, designed to operate autonomously.During my two days of being completely out of commission, all I did was occasionally check my email for reports of abnormalities — of which there were exactly zero. Every usage spike, new customer sign-up, subscription change, and routine operation continued without a hitch. The system just worked, validating all the time invested in making it robust.The key to this reliability lies in comprehensive error reporting. While it might seem annoying to receive notifications for every single error, timeout, or disconnect in your software stack, this granular monitoring is essential. As you scale, these issues naturally increase — the internet is, after all, a series of leaky tubes. Not every connection will work perfectly, and not every service will run indefinitely without needing a restart. That's just the nature of technology.Being aware of how your system operates is crucial for peace of mind when you're not operating it yourself. That's why I built performance monitoring into my software stack from the beginning. I'm particularly excited about the upcoming Laravel Night Watch tool, which was introduced at Laracon Australia a few months ago. It integrates directly with Laravel applications hosted anywhere, promising to make application performance monitoring and error tracking even more accessible.By tracking even the slightest deviations, you gradually build a more stable and reliable system. Each error notification becomes an opportunity to address a potential issue at its root, ensuring it won't cause problems in the future. When something does slip through, it's usually a novel problem that, once solved, strengthens the system further.Even in my current state, I felt compelled to record this update — not because of sponsor obligations or analytics concerns (this episode has no sponsor, and I honestly couldn't care less about the ratings), but because maintaining my weekly episode streak matters to me. It's an accountability measure, both for myself and hopefully for you. While the easy path would be to just have some tea (I am very German, after all) and go to bed, taking these few minutes to share these insights felt important.So, consider this a gentle nudge to think about how you can set up your business to function without you. Whether through delegating responsibilities to reliable team members or implementing robust automations, building a self-sustaining system allows you to step away when life demands it — whether for health, family, or any other reason. When you can take care of yourself without worrying about your business crumbling, you've built something truly valuable..​If you want to track brand mentions, search millions of transcripts, and keep an eye on chart placements for podcasts, please check out podscan.fm — and tell your friends! ​​Thank you for reading this week’s essay edition of The Bootstrapped Founder.

​Lieber Leon,

Das Jahr beginnt für uns mit einer großen Recherche bezüglich PFAS: Gemeinsam mit NDR, WDR und Süddeutscher Zeitung sowie Partnern aus ganz Europa, sind wir den auch “Ewigkeits-Chemikalien” genannten Stoffen nachgegangen und haben ein Licht auf die enorme Lobbyarbeit der Industrie geworfen. Außerdem haben wir mit dem US-Anwalt Robert Bilott aus den USA gesprochen, der die Bedrohung durch die Substanzen vor fast 25 Jahren ans Licht brachte: das große Thema der Woche.

Außerdem im Weekly Briefing: Quantencomputer im Jahr 2025: Schafft die EU die Technikrevolution? Und: Die größte Batterie der Welt arbeitet mit Rost.



Fluorchemikalien PFAS: Der harte Kampf einer Industrielobby gegen die EU



(Foto: midjourney / t3n)



Über Mikroplastik muss ich euch vermutlich nicht mehr viel erzählen. Aber wusstet ihr, dass es noch andere Stoffe gibt, die ebenfalls fast unverwüstlich sind und ohne die im Körper praktisch kein Mensch mehr zur Welt kommt? Die Rede ist von Per- und Polyfluoralkylsubstanzen, kurz PFAS, denen wir in dieser Woche einen Schwerpunkt widmen.

Worum es geht:
PFAS sind eine Familie mit mehr als 10.000 künstlichen Chemikalien. Sie sind bei der Mikrochip-Produktion im Einsatz, stecken in Elektrogeräten, Schmierstoffen und unzähligen Konsumgütern – von der Bratpfanne bis zur Brennstoffzelle. Und sie halten sich hartnäckig: Es kann Jahrhunderte dauern, bis sie abgebaut werden. Deshalb nennt man sie auch "Ewigkeits-Chemikalien".

Was passiert ist:
Weil das ein Problem ist und einige PFAS außerdem als gesichert krebserregend gelten, will die EU den Einsatz beschränken, einige sollen komplett verboten werden. Das sorgt für reichlich Gegenwind aus der Industrie. Deren Argument: Ohne PFAS geht es nicht. Doch wie die Recherche von uns und den anderen Projektpartnern zeigt, sind viele der Argumente aus der Lobby vor allem eines: faule Ausreden.

Wunsch und Wirklichkeit
So wird behauptet, dass die PFAS, die bei der Herstellung von Fluorpolymeren wie sie in Antihaftbeschichtungen oder Batterien stecken, nicht in die Umwelt gelangen würden. Studien zeigen aber, dass dem nicht so ist; eine wirklich saubere Abwicklung gibt es nicht. Das Argument, dass die Industrie sich also selbst um das Problem kümmert, zündet nicht.

Suche nach Alternativen
Ebenso wenig gilt die Behauptung, dass es keine Alternativen zu PFAS gebe. Zwar sind sie in einigen Prozessen tatsächlich derzeit kaum zu ersetzen, doch in zahlreichen Bereichen gibt es längst Alternativen. Sie sind aber teilweise teurer oder erfordern neue Anlagen. Die Lobby arbeitet deshalb hinter geschlossenen Türen an Ausnahme- und Aufschieberegeln. Der Kampf ist in vollem Gange.

Hier findet ihr unsere Recherche über PFAS und hier das Interview mit Robert Bilott. Und wer sich generell über PFAS informieren möchte, der findet alles Wissenswerte in unserem Q&A.



Quantencomputer im Jahr 2025: Schafft die EU die Technikrevolution?


Willkommen in der schönen neuen Quantenwelt. Einer Welt, in der Quantenchips hunderttausendmal schneller sind, in der Kommunikationsnetze auch von den fähigsten Angreifern nicht angezapft werden können, und Quantensensoren mit bislang ungeahnter Empfindlichkeit völlig neue Anwendungen wie etwa Hirnscanner für die Hosentasche ermöglichen. Noch ist das eine Zukunftsvision, aber sie soll schon bald Realität werden.

Worum es geht:
Weil die zugrunde liegende physikalische Theorie, die Quantenmechanik, in diesem Jahr 100 wird, haben die Vereinten Nationen das internationale Jahr der Quantenwissenschaft und -Technologie ausgerufen. Doch die großen, kapitalstarken Unternehmen wie IBM und Google, die massiv in die Entwicklung von Quantencomputern investieren, sitzen – mal wieder – in den USA. Kann Europa von dieser Technologie profitieren? Ja, sagt Tommaso Calarco vom Forschungszentrum Jülich, der das EU-Flagship-Projekt zu Quantentechnologie wesentlich mit angeschoben hat, in dem die EU 2018 beschloss, die Quantentechnologie mit einer Milliarde Euro zu fördern. Die Chancen, meint Calarco, stünden gar nicht so schlecht.

Bisher habe Europa die Technologie bereits mit neun Milliarden Euro gefördert – China offiziell mit 15 Milliarden. Auch in Sachen Kompetenz stünde Europa international konkurrenzfähig da. Ein Problem sei nur die Investitionsbereitschaft privater Unternehmen.

Hier geht's zum kompletten Interview mit Tommaso Calarco.



8.500 Megawattstunden: Die größte Batterie der Welt arbeitet mit Rost


Rost will man eigentlich nicht an einer Batterie vorfinden. Es sei denn, man verwendet den Rost zum Laden und Entladen. Genau das machen Forschende des Startups Form Energy in Massachusetts – und wollen damit den größten Batteriespeicher der Welt bauen.

Wie das funktioniert:
Luft und Eisen sorgen für Rost. Chemisch betrachtet ist nichts anderes als ein Austausch von Ladungsträgern. In der Batterie werden Metall-Elektroden aus Eisen-Hydroxid durch Strom zersetzt, es bildet sich Sauerstoff, der aus dem Elektrolyt herausblubbert – der Speicher lädt sich. Das Ganze ist unbrennbar, enthält weder giftige noch seltene Stoffe und ist unschlagbar günstig. Schon seit den 60er Jahren ist das Prinzip bekannt.

Was das bedeutet:
Dass es bislang noch keine größeren Umsetzungen gab, liegt daran, dass der Umgang mit festen, flüssigen und gasförmigen Stoffen recht kompliziert ist. Und daran, dass die Rost-Batterien einen deutlich niedrigeren Wirkungsgrad als Lithium-Ionen-Akkus haben. Bei Form Energy glaubt man dennoch, dass es sich am Ende rechnet. In einer alten Papiermühle in Maine soll bis 2028 der Weltrekord-Speicher mit 8.500 MWh entstehen.

Mehr über die Rost-Batterie erfahrt ihr hier.

The $15B Accidental Startup
Most people think Discord's $15B success started as a chat app. But that's the sanitized version. The real story is far more interesting. You'll learn where some of the biggest startup ideas come from.

Before Discord, founder Jason Citron built a mobile game company called Aurora Feint. Despite the funding and a talented team, the game was failing. But hidden in the usage data was something fascinating.


Jason Citron the man, the myth, the legend
Players weren't logging in to play. They were logging in to use this tiny social feature that let them chat while gaming. Some kept the app open for hours, barely touching the actual game.

Instead of ignoring this behavior, Citron went all in. He transformed that small feature into OpenFeint - a social network for mobile games. Within 18 months, OpenFeint was on 250M phones and sold to GREE for $104M.

Years later, history repeated itself. Citron started a new game studio company when they noticed their internal chat tool was getting more usage than their actual game. Once again, he spotted the pattern and pivoted. That became Discord.

The insight isn't to ignore customer research. Obviously not. For those of you who are long time readers, you know I'm a big fan of doing "voice of customer" surveys.

But sometimes the best market research often happens when you watch what customers actually do with your product, not just what they say in surveys. When you really understand what the community is doing with the tool better than they even know themselves, that's an insight you need to hold onto.

Citron's superpower wasn't building chat apps. It was spotting patterns in user behavior and having the courage to double down on them - even if it meant scrapping everything else.

Look for the features users are bending to their will.

Sometimes your biggest opportunity is hiding inside your current product, wearing a disguise.

By the way...

I did some filming last week in Miami for the pod. Trying to do more IRL stuff. I love it and think you might too.

Here was my episode with Cody Schneider about how to grow your startup on YouTube, Apple, Spotify.


More IRL pods coming within the next 3-4 weeks. One of the pods I recorded was life-changing. Can't wait for you to see it. Spoiler alert: it was with David Senra from Founders.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS

AI RESEARCH
🚀 François Chollet founds new AGI lab

Image source: Ndea

The Rundown: François Chollet, former Google researcher and the creator of the popular Keras AI framework, just introduced Ndea, a new AI lab aiming to achieve AGI through an alternative research method, alongside Zapier founder Mike Knoop.

The details:

Ndea's core strategy combines deep learning with program synthesis, aiming to create AI that can learn and adapt with human-level efficiency.

The startup positions itself as an alternative to the dominant large-scale deep learning approach, arguing that training data limits current AI.

Ndea plans to build what they call a "factory for rapid scientific advancement," focusing on both known frontiers like drug discovery and unexplored territories.

Chollet also recently launched the ARC Prize Foundation, a nonprofit that is developing benchmarks to evaluate human-level AI capabilities.

Why it matters: Chollet is a massive figure in AI — and his decision to create his own lab could offer a fresh perspective in the race to AGI. With Ndea, Ilya Sutskever’s SSI, and many of the brightest minds in AI taking different research angles, the groundbreaking achievement could come from any corner of the industry.

MICROSOFT
🤖 Microsoft expands Copilot access with free tier

Image source: Microsoft

The Rundown: Microsoft just introduced Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, a rebranded free entry-level version of its AI assistant platform that introduces pay-per-use agent capabilities while maintaining core AI features for business users.

The details:

The new tier offers free access to GPT-4o-powered chat, which includes web-based knowledge, file analysis capabilities, and image and code generation.

Users can access custom AI agents for task automation, with a consumption-based model at $0.01 per message or $200 for 25,000 messages monthly.

Agents can leverage knowledge sources for a range of tasks and actions, and the Copilot Control System allows IT teams to manage the platform easily.

The offering aims to bridge the gap between free users and the full Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription ($30/user/month).

Why it matters: Microsoft’s launch is a shot at Gemini’s free push into its Workplace apps, but the differentiator (for now) is the agentic capabilities. For orgs looking to continue integrating AI easily across their knowledge bases and employees, Microsoft still looks like a powerhouse — though it will have no shortage of fast-moving rivals.

AI TRAINING
👔 Try on any clothes virtually

The Rundown: Hugging Face’s new Leffa space allows you to try on any piece of clothing virtually by uploading your photo and a garment image.

Step-by-step:

Visit the Leffa project space on Hugging Face - no registration is needed.

Upload your full-body photo and the garment you want to try.

In Advanced Options, select your garment type (upper, lower, or dress) and click Generate to see yourself in new clothes.

Pro tip: For the best results, use clear, front-facing photos against simple backgrounds. This is perfect for previewing online shopping purchases.

PRESENTED BY CONTEXTUAL
🤖 Contextual AI releases state-of-the-art RAG platform

The Rundown: Contextual AI, pioneers of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), just launched the Contextual AI platform to help organizations build specialized RAG agents designed for complex, technical, and knowledge-intensive tasks.

With the Contextual AI Platform, you can:

Build specialized RAG agents that achieve exceptional accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks

Reason over massive volumes of unstructured and structured data

Maximize user trust with protections against hallucinations and precise citations

Read the full announcement to learn more and request platform access.

LUMA LABS
🎥 Luma Labs drops new next-gen AI video model

Image source: Luma Labs

The Rundown: Luma Labs just released Ray 2, the startup’s next-generation AI video model — which promises unprecedented motion quality and physics realism through a new multimodal architecture trained with 10x more computing power than its predecessor.

The details:

The model can generate high-quality video clips up to 10 seconds long from text prompts, and it has advanced motion and physics capabilities.

Ray2 demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of object interactions, from natural scenes like water physics to complex human movements.

Ray2 can currently handle text, image, and video-to-video generations, and Luma will soon add editing capabilities to the model.

The system is launching first in Luma’s Dream Machine platform for paid subscribers, with API access coming soon.

Why it matters: Veo 2’s launch around the holidays felt like a new level of realism and quality for AI video, and now Luma punches back with some heat of its own. It’s becoming impossible to discern AI video from reality — and the question is which lab will crack longer-length, coherent outputs and unlock a new realm of creative power.

Nvidia’s Big AI Bets

Via Business Insider

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang didn’t hold back at CES 2025, dropping insights about where Nvidia—and AI—are headed. Here are three standout moments (and keep reading for my recap on all things CES) ➡️ 

AI in the real world: Huang introduced Cosmos, an AI that understands gravity, inertia, and physical space, a game-changer for robots and self-driving cars.

AI at your desk: Nvidia is working to bring high-power, cloud-level AI to personal PCs.

AI in the gaming universe: DLSS 4 generates 31 million pixels per frame, leaving just 2 million for GPUs to render. Translation? Stunning visuals at a fraction of the effort.

Why it matters: Nvidia often leads the charge when it comes to AI and futuristic tech. Now that we know what’s on the company’s radar, there’s a good chance other big players aren’t far behind. 

 
 
 
Elon Musk’s AI Pet Project
Elon Musk has turned X (formerly Twitter) into his personal sandbox for AI experiments, according to new reporting from The Verge. Musk has reportedly been using X, which he bought in 2022, as a distribution channel for his $50 billion AI startup, xAI.

Using xAI’s Grok LLM, X now has AI-generated trending story summaries and questions on posts.

X is allegedly developing even more AI-powered tools, like letting Grok modify your tweets or asking location-based queries to the chatbot.

The result? Blurred lines between social media and AI. But also a growing sense that Musk is transforming X into something new—whether we like it or not.

Thinner, smarter, and surprisingly ambitious—this year looks big for Apple. What’s expected to be on the product roadmap?

iPhone 17 is rumored to include an ultra-thin Air model.

The iPhone SE will potentially ditch the home button for Face ID and AI upgrades.

Apple’s other bets? iPads with a power boost, a smart home hub with conversational Siri, and whispers of foldables and AR/VR innovations.

The big picture: Apple has had some missteps and glitches with AI over the years—will 2025 be its year?

Alright, I’ll admit it. I used to be a DocuSign guy until I realized I was paying hundreds of dollars per month simply to send and receive signed documents. Then I found Agree.com.

Agree made e-signature free for everyone… and then loaded the platform with killer features like automated invoicing, integrated payments, and revenue recovery.

Now I can send, sign, and get paid—all in one place. No more waiting around for checks or jumping between apps. Agree.com doesn’t just save me hundreds of dollars every month; it gets me to the good part faster: seeing money hit my account.

As a founder myself, I gotta say my favorite part about Agree.com is that their founders are accessible and dialed in to making the product 10x better than the alternative.

I already know you’re smart because you read Big Desk Energy. Now you can show others that you’re smart because you send contracts with Agree.

Using Agree.com is an IQ test.

What do all of the following companies have in common: Google, Tesla, eBay, NVIDIA, Zoom, Stripe, Robinhood, Cloudflare, Instacart, SpaceX, Palantir, Slack, Duolingo, Roblox.


Toad buying you some time to think before seeing the answer

They were all founded, or co-founded, by immigrants.

Now imagine these immigrants were never allowed to enter and work in the US. The ~375,000 people employed by these companies wouldn’t have the same well paying jobs they do today, and the $7T in aggregate market cap would be contributing to other economies and countries around the world.

This is also a drastic over-simplification. It doesn’t account for the taxes generated for federal and state governments (yes, I’m aware there are loopholes), the substantial income taxes paid by their highly compensated employees, or the contributions these 375,000 employees make within their local communities. Not to mention that these companies are home to some of the world's most innovative technologies.

The overwhelmingly obvious point I’m trying to make here: the U.S. as a whole is considerably better off because these companies exist, and were built here in America. Note that it only took about 10 companies to illustrate that; but there are thousands to choose from.

I know the whole kerfuffle (always wanted to use that word) over H1-B visas happened a few weeks ago, but I was in Costa Rica enjoying my time off during the holidays. I’ve got a few thoughts and a newsletter, so here we are.

Some may consider the debate political; it’s not — it’s common sense. Believe it or not, not everything worthy of debate needs to be reduced to two opposing political sides.

If you too were busy actually enjoying the holidays, I’ll give a quick recap:

The H-1B visa program allows U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers, requiring a bachelor’s degree or higher. There are 85,000 visas issued each year.

It’s common for tech companies to leverage H-1B to hire talent from across the world. SpaceX and Tesla obtained 724 H-1B visas last year. Yeah, that last sentence had a citation (put a capital “J” Journalist next to my name).

Over the holidays, Trump appointed Sriram Krishnan to be an advisor on AI policy. Krishnan is an Indian American VC who was most recently a General Partner at A16Z.

Far-right activists like Laura Loomer criticized the appointment claiming it would oppose “Trump’s America First agenda.” This set off a firestorm of tweets and debate between the far-right MAGA crowd who are mostly anti-immigrant, and those who have recently gained influence in Trump’s inner circle and have leveraged the government’s H-1B program for their own businesses (Elon, Vivek Ramaswamy, etc.)

You have permission to feel however you’d like about Elon. What you can’t argue is his contribution to the world (and the U.S.).

He has built Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI, The Boring Company, and also runs X (formerly Twitter). Collectively they employ over 150,000 people (in the U.S.), and are pushing the boundaries of transportation, energy storage, aerospace, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence, and free speech.

A recent criticism is that he yields far too much power, wealth, and influence as a private citizen. And to be honest, I agree. I don’t think an unelected official should be able to unilaterally deploy internet and communication infrastructure in an active European warzone.

That said — I’m at least grateful that the person who does have those capabilities is an American citizen rather than one of an adversary. That was only made possible because Elon previously immigrated to the U.S. on an H-1B visa. It’s a vehicle to bring the best and brightest to contribute to the American economy.

Hard pivot from geopolitical power, but imagine the NBA without Embiid, Luka, Giannis, Jokić, Kyrie, SGA, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins and the dozens of other international superstars. The NBA would be a shell of itself without them.

Fortunately Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner, allows these “foreigners” to participate because they are some of the most talented players in the world. His job is to put the best product out on the court to the benefit of the fans, the owners, the shareholders, the networks, the advertisers, and the local communities.

The utmost American thing you could possibly want is for the most talented people from around the world to willingly choose to upend their lives and move to the U.S. These are skilled workers who are contributing to American innovation, building their own companies, paying their taxes, and employing many thousands of American citizens.

The same way the NBA is a better product because it openly accepts the best players on merit — Silicon Valley and the companies shaping the future are far superior when they are built by the world’s most talented engineers.

There are over 8 billion people on the planet today. Contrary to what some believe, the U.S. doesn’t have a monopoly of talent — it has a monopoly of arrogance.

At beehiiv we currently have an open role for a Data Engineer. As CEO, my only priority is to hire someone who can best excel in the role and help us succeed. I couldn’t care less where that employee lives, where they were born, their gender, religion, ethnicity, or favorite movie. I just need the best data engineer (if this is you, you should apply).

What Laura and the protectionist MAGA wing would argue is that I actually should only hire the best American worker, even if that candidate is far inferior to the others in our pipeline.

The result: we end up with a mediocre data engineer, which makes us just a bit less competitive and less likely to succeed.

Granted, a single subpar hire likely wouldn’t be the downfall of beehiiv. But when we are now forced to hire inferior candidates across all of our open engineering roles, it has a negative compounding effect on our ability to compete in a global market.

While building the best newsletter platform may not be one of America’s top national interests (it’s my top national interest fwiw) — being home to the dominant companies in industries like aerospace, defense, AI, crypto, and energy likely are. The asinine government overreach to enforce only hiring American workers would put these companies at risk of falling behind their international competitors.

Unless it were true that the absolute most talented and qualified person for every single open role just so happened to be born in the U.S., the only thing that protectionism does is diminish the quality and output of American companies.

Rather than forcing companies to hire American workers, shouldn’t politicians instead prioritize and invest in programs that would improve the education and training of American youth so that Americans are the most talented and qualified?

The problem with that solution is that it would take decades, and instead the American political complex is built on short-term incentives. When politicians' top priority is to remain in power via election cycles that range from 2 to 6 years, where’s the incentive to invest in long-term solutions?

Look, I’m not a policy expert, nor am I interested in politics. It’s just that politicians who intentionally promote xenophobic and protectionist policies in the name of “America first” actually undermine the competitive nature of America.

It impacts Silicon Valley, it impacts our national defense, and it impacts every American citizen and consumer. It’s not political; it’s common sense.

Zur neuen HubSpot AI: Breeze

 
 
 
AI-HOY AInauten,

Willkommen zur neuen Ausgabe deines Lieblingsnewsletters. Wir haben mit den neuen NotebookLM Features experimentiert - und uns vertieft mit der Frage befasst, was passiert, wenn die AGI Superintelligenz aufschlägt. Herausgekommen sind 7 Praxis-Strategien.

Das haben wir heute für dich im Gepäck:

🗣️ Werde zum Experten mit NotebookLMs neuem AI-Coach

🌈 Die AGI Superintelligenz kommt: 7 Tipps, um dich darauf vorzubereiten

😁 AI-Fun: Wenn Dich KI bis ins Schlafzimmer verfolgt …

Los geht’s!

 
🗣️ Werde zum Experten mit NotebookLMs neuem AI-Coach
Du kennst ja bereits die Möglichkeit, mit NotebookLM einen Audio Overview Podcast zu erstellen. Seit ein paar Wochen geht aber noch mehr: mit dem Interactive Mode kannst du direkt dazwischen quasseln und interaktiv mit den Hosts sprechen.


Und das eröffnet ganz neue Use Cases! Du kannst dich zum Beispiel von den Hosts coachen und abfragen lassen. Ideal, wenn du dich auf eine Klausur vorbereiten möchtest oder dein Wissen zu einem Thema vertiefen willst.

Lade dafür wie gehabt deine Unterlagen in ein Notebook hoch, und lasse aus deinen Materialien einen Audio Overview generieren:

Der Host nimmt die Rolle eines Teachers/Coach ein und startet sofort. 

Er testet das Wissen des Experten auf Basis des hochgeladenen Materials. Es ist wie ein Quiz, bei dem auch Folgefragen und Multiple-Choice-Antworten vom Host gestellt werden.

Unterhaltung findet auf Deutsch statt, die Inhalte des hochgeladenen Dokuments werden auf kulturelle Relevanz und passende idiomatische Ausdrücke angepasst. 

Alle Inhalte auf Deutsch, kein Englisch, kein Akzent! Wichtig: Zuhörer verstehen nur Deutsch!
Und jetzt wird's spannend! Klicke auf Interactive Mode und während des Abspielens kannst du dann auf "Join" klicken, und deine Fragen stellen (oder Antworten geben).

Es ist dabei wichtig, dass du zu Beginn deutlich sagst, dass alle Antworten auf Deutsch sein müssen (manchmal kann es auch sein, dass du das auf Englisch sagen musst: “Respond only in German!”). Und wenn sich die Hosts etwas unbeholfen anstellen sollten, musst du deine Anfrage einfach wiederholen oder umformulieren.

Join and interact with NotebookLM Audio Overviews

Aber keine Bange, das sind nur die Startschwierigkeiten, und wenn du mal drin bist, wird Lernen interaktiv und macht richtig Spaß!

Für generelle Themen kannst du natürlich auch ChatGPTs Advanced Voice Mode nutzen. Der Vorteil von NotebookLM ist aber, dass die spezifischen Quelldaten als Studienmaterial zum Einsatz kommen. Give it a try! Mehr Details inkl. Playbook gibt es auch im AInauten Premium-Bereich.


 
🌈 Die AGI Superintelligenz kommt: 7 Tipps, um dich darauf vorzubereiten
Die nächste Evolutionsstufe der AI steht vor der Tür und könnte wird unser Leben komplett auf den Kopf stellen.

Ja, wir sprechen von der Ära der Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - von Maschinen, die jede intellektuelle Aufgabe bewältigen, die ein Mensch auch leisten kann.

Seit wir unsere Intelligenz mithilfe von Sprache, Schrift und digitalen Technologien festhalten, bereiten wir uns unbewusst auf den Moment vor, in dem AGI zur Realität wird. Diese Entwicklung ist keine Science-Fiction, sondern nahezu unvermeidlich.

Wirtschaft im Wandel: Neue Spielregeln durch AGI
Was AGI genau bedeutet, ist schwierig festzunageln. Aber es ist davon auszugehen, dass es für eine radikale Umgestaltung unserer Wirtschaft sorgen wird. Traditionelle Geschäftsmodelle werden obsolet, während neue, technologiegetriebene Ansätze entstehen. Heutige Jobs werden überflüssig oder können viel effizienter erledigt werden.

Damit verschiebt sich auch die Bedeutung deiner Arbeitskraft hin zu Kapitalbesitz!

Sam Altman sinniert öffentlich über die Auswirkungen der Superintelligenz, während die neue Regierung in Washington deregulieren will - und Experten wie Max Tegmark und Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt vor den Gefahren warnen.

Fakt ist: Wer Zugang zu A(G)I-Infrastruktur hat, kann künftig den größten Einfluss auf Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft ausüben. Und das bedeutet für viele eine zunehmende Abhängigkeit von wenigen mächtigen Akteuren…

Die Frage, die wir uns deshalb immer wieder stellen: Wie können wir uns/du dich persönlich auf diese radikale Veränderung vorbereiten?


Hier einige Strategien, was du heute schon tun kannst, um morgen gerüstet zu sein:

1) Finde die Insider und umgib dich mit den richtigen Leuten
Erinnerst du dich an die COVID-19-Pandemie? Das Chaos, die ständigen Veränderungen? In Zeiten rasanter Veränderungen ist es entscheidend, Menschen um sich zu haben, die ein Verständnis dafür mitbringen, was abgeht und was die Konsequenzen sind.

Such dir also Experten und Vordenker, die den Durchblick haben. Gemeinsam navigiert es sich leichter durch den AI-Dschungel! Die AI-Revolution ist ein Team-Sport, und Einzelkämpfer werden keine Champions. Was du jetzt brauchst, ist ein starkes Netzwerk, das dir Türen öffnet, bevor andere überhaupt wissen, dass es diese Türen gibt.


AGI Timelines der wichtigsten AI CEOs (via X)

2) Spare clever und bilde ein finanzielles Polster
Verstehe die potenziellen wirtschaftlichen Störungen und bereite dich darauf vor. Unternehmen und Mitarbeiter müssen sich anpassen, um wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben - während Regierungen vor der schwierigen Herausforderung stehen, fruchtbare Rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen…

Länder mit starker AI-Industrie könnten enorme Wohlstandsgewinne verzeichnen. Die USA stehen hier an vorderster Front, aber auch Verbündete wie die EU, Großbritannien, Japan, Südkorea, Australien und Kanada könnten profitieren. Wer in diesen Ländern verwurzelt ist, kann auf der KI-Welle mitsurfen.

AGI könnte zunächst zu steigenden Löhnen führen, aber wird langfristig auch viele Jobs überflüssig machen. Vielleicht gibt es ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen (“Universal Basic Income UBI”) - aber vielleicht auch nicht… Und dann könnte dein Erspartes die Haupteinnahmequelle sein.

Das Gute ist, dass es in den nächsten Jahren noch einen richtigen Boom gibt, wo du davon profitieren kannst. Die Möglichkeiten sind endlos. Nutze sie!

3) Investiere klug und setze auf zukunftssichere Anlagen
In Zeiten des Wandels sind traditionelle Anlagestrategien nicht mehr ausreichend. Ein diversifiziertes Portfolio ist der Schlüssel, um finanzielle Turbulenzen zu meistern. Überlege deshalb, wie du dein Geld in Bereichen investieren kannst, die vom Aufstieg der AGI profitieren oder zumindest stabil bleiben.

Die offensichtliche Wertschöpfungskette reicht von Chip-Herstellern über Cloud-Provider bis hin zu AI-First Startups. Aber gehe tiefer, und verstehe die Game Changer von morgen: Quantum Computing, Neural Networks, Edge Computing, … das sind mehr als nur Buzzwords.

4) Bereite dich auf turbulente Zeiten vor und kultiviere mentale Stärke
Zusätzlich zu allen anderen globalen Herausforderungen könnte auch die Ankunft von AGI globale Instabilität verursachen. Neben Cyberangriffen und neuen Waffen wird es auch politische und soziale Spannungen geben.

Dein Wohlbefinden ist dein wertvollstes Gut. Bereite dich deshalb auf mögliche Krisen vor: Ein eigener Bunker muss es ja nicht sein, aber mentale Stärke wird wichtiger denn je, um mit Stress und Unsicherheit umzugehen.

Meditation, Community, Sport, Religion, Self-Help - was immer dir dabei hilft, eine unerschütterliche mentale Festung aufzubauen. Und vergiss nicht, ein Netzwerk von Gleichgesinnten aufzubauen, die mit dir durch dick und dünn gehen.


via X

5) Feile an deinen “Human Skills” - ein unfairer Vorteil
Die AI-Revolution wirft ethische Fragen auf: Privacy vs. Innovation, Human Agency vs. AI Automation …

Doch während Maschinen uns in logischen und repetitiven Tasks überholen, werden menschliche Superpowers immer wichtiger. Kreativität, emotionale Intelligenz, kritisches Denken, Eigeninitiative - lerne, und wende es an! Und ja, es ist okay, wenn ChatGPT dafür dein Sparringspartner ist 😀 …

Fakt ist: Diese Skills sind entscheidend für die Gegenwart und Zukunft. Während AI immer besser wird in der Analyse von Daten, werden Menschen, die kreativ denken, emotional connecten und kritisch reflektieren können, gefragter denn je.

6) Werde ein lebenslang lernender Hybrid-Professional
Pure Fachexpertise war gestern gefragt. Heute brauchst du den Mix aus fachlichem Wissen gepaart mit AI-Skills. Du musst der Übersetzer sein zwischen der alten und der neuen Welt!

Theorie ist gut, Praxis ist besser! Der Schlüssel? Experimentiere täglich mindestens eine Stunde mit AI-Tools. Ja, TÄGLICH! Starte am besten mit einem AI-Audit deines Berufsfelds: Welche Tasks werden automatisiert? Wo entstehen neue Opportunities? Werde ein lebenslanger Lerner, und investiere in deine persönliche Weiterbildung.

7) Denke langfristig und bleibe flexibel
Auch wenn AGI vielleicht noch nicht unmittelbar bevorsteht, wir glauben fest daran, dass die Superintelligenz in den nächsten Jahren kommt. Die oben genannten Strategien stärken deine Position und machen dich resilienter, anpassungsfähiger.

Du kannst dich damit wappnen, um in der neuen Ära voll aufzugehen! Der technologische Fortschritt macht menschliche Freude oder Ziele nicht obsolet, ganz im Gegenteil!

P.S. It’s happening already…

The Koe Letter

Read the online version here.

–––

Before we begin, a few updates:

Kortex, the writing and second brain software we've been building, is seeing quite a few improvements this month:

Desktop app (released yesterday with floating capture and docs)
Light mode (releasing today)
Mobile app (releasing this week)
Offline mode (releasing this month)
Voice transcription (this month)
Sessions, images, and embeds in capture (this month)
Kortex AI for editing, research, and speeding up your writing (this month)
Next month, we begin working on the library redesign so you can save any link or file, have it automatically transcribed, read and highlight anything across the web, and string it all together with AI.

If you want a new home for your writing, projects, ideas, and notes, this month is the month to do it. The price is increasing when AI features are released (we decided not to add on an additional price like Notion).

You can read about this month's plan or sign up here.

–––

Everyone wants to be an original thinker.

I did too.

As a teenager, I would watch lectures from people like Jordan Peterson and Alan Watts and stare in awe as they articulated their thoughts in a beautiful way.

Why couldn't I do the same? Was I not smart enough? Was I not old enough yet? No matter how much information I burned through in books or absorbed from lectures, it never seemed to help.

I had the thoughts in my head, but when it came time to articulate them, all that came out was a jumbled mess of half-baked ideas that could barely be understood after all of the stuttering.

When I first started writing, I would often stare at a blank page as the negative thoughts started to pile in. I had no idea why I was writing or what I was writing about, but I had some idea that I felt the need to share with the world.

Were the words just supposed to pop into my head?

Okay, I've got one sentence down… what now?

I'm sure you've felt the same way at some point in your life.

The problem, in my eyes, is that when you go to school, you don't learn how to think. You learn how to memorize and "rewrite things in your own words." As kids, deep down, we know how silly this is, so we do the bare minimum to get the work done.

But that's not how the real world works.

You aren't rewarded for thinking someone else's thoughts.

In fact, since your thoughts influence your actions, that's a great way to end up just like them. Do you want the same life as them? I'm guessing not.

I've been a writer now for almost 5 years. Not an academic writer. No English degree. Just a guy who puts his thoughts on the internet. Since many people enjoy those thoughts, I have a few tricks I can share.

If you want to be a better writer, creator, or speaker, or simply want to be respected for your mind—not your body or physical effort—you need to become an original thinker.

But sometimes, the secret to being original is not being original at all.

How To Form Your Own Opinion


You don't have your own opinion because your survival is dependent on agreeing with others' opinions.

Think about it.

You needed approval if you didn't want to be cast out of the "tribe."

You absorb the values from the environment you were raised in because you need them to survive.

This can get very messy very quick.

If your parents are set on you getting a degree, even if it's not the best decision for you, you will be pressured into being a good little student. If you don't, you may lose your parent's approval if they aren't open-minded.

Let's take a more dangerous example.

If your parents are racist and narrow-minded, they won't approve of you if you don't adopt that same racism. And you're just too young to know better from worse.In that scenario, they are much more likely to kick you out of the house or stop supporting you.

The mind is unforgiving in this manner. Once your worldview forms, it starts to reinforce itself through confirmation. Your mind sees within its structure, so you notice information that aids in the survival of that structure.

One last example. An even more dangerous one.

If you're raised in a Christian environment and tried to go to an underdeveloped part of the world, your beliefs could literally get you jailed or killed. It doesn't matter how "true" your beliefs are or how "wrong" the other ones are.

Makes sense, but what does this have to do with becoming an original thinker?

Simple:

You haven't been thinking independently for your entire life.

Become A Skeptic – Stepping Into The Mental Gym
Original thinking is difficult work.

That's why many people don't do it.

In today's world, it's even more difficult.

You don't just absorb the values, beliefs, identity, and worldview that your parents installed into you.

You absorb the ideas of the hundreds of thousands of people you are exposed to on the internet over the course of a few months.

Just because you don't live with your parents or go to school anymore doesn't mean you don't want approval and acceptance. You've just swapped tribes with the one you've found in school, online, or other social circles. You still want to be approved, but this time, it's by the digital group you belong to.

But that's not how you do anything great.

You need to step out of the nice cozy home your mind has adapted to and step into the mental gym.

When you first step into the gym, it's daunting. You don't want to go. You're afraid of embarrassing yourself. You are threatening the current structure of your mind that allows you to survive, unless that group you belong to encourages you to step in the gym.

The first step to becoming an original thinker is to reject any prior belief, ideology, value, or idea because when you absorbed them, you didn't question them. I don't care how "right" you think they are. If you didn't think them through from scratch, you can only assume they are wrong.

When I say reject everything, I mean everything.

You need a radically open mind if you want to think outside of the box you didn't know existed.

For all I care, you weren't born from your mother. You weren't there to see it, were you?

For all I care, every single thing you think is absolutely true is absolutely false.

How do you practice this?

By becoming a skeptic.

Not the type of skeptic you see on Reddit or in YouTube debates.

A true skeptic who is skeptical of their own skepticism.

Someone who is skeptical about one belief but not their own is not a skeptic. They're simply blind and dumb.

For to every account an equal account is opposed; and from this, we think, we come to hold no beliefs.

Sextus Empiricus

In other words, for every argument, there is an equally strong opposing argument. You can argue in any direction about any topic until you die and never come to a conclusion. Once you understand this, you suspend judgment and cease to hold firm beliefs.

This isn't to say that you should not act with conviction toward your goals. It means that you are willing to pivot without resistance once you are exposed to better information.

You practice skepticism in today's world by trying to prove yourself wrong.

If you're on social media, you'll be convinced of the "best" diet model, business model, and set of values to conduct your life and relationships.

People read a convincing post about the carnivore diet (or AI business model or life advice), get a dopamine hit because it aids in their survival, immediately search up the benefits of it, and condition themselves into a dogmatic worldview. It becomes their identity, and they'll ignore all truth to push their new religion on others.

Your job is to suspend judgment and attachment.

Your job is to question from all angles and research all perspectives.

Your job is to prove yourself wrong and understand every moving part of the argument.

From there, you can come to your own opinion. You are no longer bound by the mind you were programmed with.

But that's just the start.

How do you come up with original ideas?

How do you structure your ideas in a way that others value in your writing, speaking, and creative work?

What do you read to find deep ideas?

Let's talk about it.

5 Ways To Think Originally
Here's the thing:

Original thinking is largely a myth.

Becoming a (true) skeptic opens your mind to less limited thinking, but it doesn't guarantee that all of your thoughts will be absolutely original.

And that's okay.

Because original thinking is perception.

Perception is dependent on identity.

Identity is dependent on conditioning, values, beliefs, conscious or unconscious goals, and the rest.

Some people who read my book are mind-blown at its originality (not my words ;).

Others have left reviews saying it's "nothing new," and they've heard it all before.

Personally, I felt it was pretty unique. At least, it was to my mind. But that's just something you'll have to deal with when you decide to put your thoughts out into the world.

Certain identities, at certain points in their development, will see your ideas as original. Many won't. And that's fine.

Do you actually think all of Peterson's and Watts' ideas have never been said before? Or are they simply articulatinga good idea in a way that a specific group of people perceive as great?

Now that we are skeptics, how do we discover, articulate, and create ideas that few people have heard before?

The answer is the key to most of your creative success as a writer, founder, or creator.

1) Say The Same Thing, But From Your Perspective
Most writers struggle because they feel as if they're saying what's already been said.

I know this because I teach writing in 2 Hour Writer and talk with writers and creators daily in the Kortex Discord.

Here's the thing:

Originality is less about saying something new and more about exploring existing ideas in a fresh way.

This takes effort. Mental labor. Endurance running for your psyche. You need to set aside time to think through an idea without distractions. Go on a walk.

Second, saying the same thing isn't bad.

The best advice in business is to "sell what's already selling but with your own twist."

You stick your hand in the river that's already flowing.

The same holds true with creative work. Certain ideas will always do well. It is smart to talk about them so you can get some traction.

The key is to talk about those ideas from a novel perspective.

Funnily enough, this is what will save creators from becoming irrelevant with the wave of AI content.

But how do you do that?

2) Read What Few People Have Before
The best ideas I've found are the ones collecting dust in little-known books, podcasts, videos, and posts.

The point:

Most people aren't original, they are just talking about ideas you haven't seen before.

If you're consuming the same information that everyone else is, it's no wonder you feel like you're saying the same thing as them.

Stop reading mainstream books.

Stop watching mainstream content.

Stop only getting your information from the algorithm.

You need to actively hunt for ideas.

Again, this takes effort. Most of that effort is going to be wasted. You aren't going to find the perfect book, video, or post with one Google search.

Go down more rabbit holes.

Avoid getting distracted.

Let one idea lead to another until you're in a place where few people go.

3) Connect Ideas From Different Disciplines
I get my best ideas when I want to write about one topic, like business, but study something completely different, like philosophy.

In fact, these usually turn into my most memorable writing and videos.

If you watch any of my most popular videos, you'll notice that I attempt to weave a business concept like "niching down" with another concept like ego development theory or identity.

I knew that "levels of awareness" in marketing were a thing, so when I came across the book Awareness by Anthony De Mello, it was pretty incredible how novel ideas started to spring up, which brought a new dimension to a boring business concept.

This is much easier to do in long from writing or video.

I've said this many times before, but if you are a creator who only makes short-form content, you're not building as much reputation as you think you are. There's a reason you remember the author or a life-changing book you read more than you remember the last viral TikTok you watched. It's because a book holds your attention for 8 hours while a post holds it for 5 seconds. You don't have enough time to spark transformation in their life. You don't have enough time to be valuable.

Social media is good for generating traffic while newsletters, podcasts, and videos are good for almost everything else.

The point:

Stop studying the thing you are already good at.

Zoom out a layer and start connecting the dots between different disciplines.

If you're into marketing, study psychology or spirituality.

If you're into philosophy, study business and social media.

Write about the connections you make.

4) Stop Being Afraid Of Frameworks
Creative people are allergic to frameworks for no good reason.

They think that frameworks ruin authenticity or something like that.

What they fail to realize is that creativity flourishes when it has constraints.

You can't think outside the box if there is no box.

Almost everything I write or speak stems from a simple framework:

Problem and Process.

Here's a guided template if you want it.

Any idea I have, I immediately think about a problem or pain point associated with that idea. This gives my mind an angle to grasp onto. It's almost natural for me to

Why start with a problem?

It captures attention
It qualifies the reader or listener (what's in it for me?)
It is the start of any good story
It opens a curiosity loop
It frames the ideas that come next, like a story or solution
If you want to think originally, then think of a problem that is different from the idea and start there.

Try it.

Pick an idea from this letter, like "being skeptical of your own skepticism."

Think of a problem related to that.

Think of an example or story that illustrates the problem.

Think of a process or solution that helps solve the problem.

Tada!

Now you have a newsletter, YouTube video, social post, or even the starting point of a book.

You may even have an idea for a business to start that helps people solve that problem.

5) Experimentation Is Your Teacher
You live in your body.

You live with your mind.

You live with other people.

You live with responsibilities.

It should be considered your full-time job to learn about them, practice skills that improve them, and master those domains.

Since most thinking starts with a problem, and experimentation (not prescription) is how you solve problems for good, then original thinking is the byproduct of experience.

You gain experience by noticing your own problems.

You notice your own problems by snapping out of your mindless routine of trivial tasks.

You look at yourself in the mirror and be honest about your discontentment.

You dig deeper to get to the root of that problem.

"I don't like how I look" > "I'm uncomfortable taking my shirt off" > "My wife/husband deserves better" > "I don't have the energy to build the life I want" > "People won't respect me if I keep doing this" > "I don't want to end up alone"

Now you are problem-aware.

Start researching and experimenting with solutions.

When you start in the gym, you have no idea what you're doing. You're better off buying a program and studying nutrition until you grasp the fundamentals. With enough study (and not latching onto specific training or diet ideologies) you can start experimenting to discover a better way of doing things.

Slowly, then all at once, you create your own original way of thinking about a specific domain of life.

That's valuable.

That's what people want to follow, purchase, and support.

That's how you turn your mind into a creative machine that others can't help but be attracted to.

Thank you for reading.

I hope it helped.
